Drinking Hats is a light-hearted mod for Cataclysm:Dark Days Ahead made because we want to store liquids on our heads and drink hands-free.

Mostly has hats and some helmets, excluding historical metal helmets.

Most drinking headgear variants are crafting using a Rubber Hose, 2 aluminum cans, 2 small bottles, or 2 hip flasks.
